        <p class="card">Turtles are reptiles of the order Testudines, characterized by a special shell developed mainly
            from their
            ribs. Modern turtles are divided into two major groups, the Pleurodira (side necked turtles) and Cryptodira
            (hidden necked turtles), which differ in the way the head retracts. There are 360 living and recently
            extinct species of turtles, including land-dwelling tortoises and freshwater terrapins. They are found on
            most continents, some islands and, in the case of sea turtles, much of the ocean. Like other amniotes
            (reptiles, birds, and mammals) they breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater, although many species live
            in or around water.

            Turtle shells are made mostly of bone; the upper part is the domed carapace, while the underside is the
            flatter plastron or belly-plate. Its outer surface is covered in scales made of keratin, the material of
            hair, horns, and claws. The carapace bones develop from ribs that grow sideways and develop into broad flat
            plates that join up to cover the body. Turtles are ectotherms or "cold-blooded", meaning that their internal
            temperature varies with their direct environment. They are generally opportunistic omnivores and mainly feed
            on plants and animals with limited movements. Many turtles migrate short distances seasonally. Sea turtles
            are the only reptiles that migrate long distances to lay their eggs on a favored beach.
