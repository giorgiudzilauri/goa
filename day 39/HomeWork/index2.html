            <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves (Latin: [ˈaveːs]),
                characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic
                rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in
                size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in) common ostrich. There are over
                11,000 living species and they are split into 44 orders. More than half are passerine or "perching"
                birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without
                wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the
                ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including
                ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds
                are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds
                and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming. The study of birds is called ornithology.

            <h1 class="h-2">Evolution</h1>
            <p class="p-1">Aves and a sister group, the order Crocodilia, contain the only living representatives of the
                reptile clade Archosauria. During the late 1990s, Aves was most commonly defined phylogenetically as all
                descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx lithographica.[13]
                However, an earlier definition proposed by Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century,
                and is used by many scientists including adherents to the PhyloCode. Gauthier defined Aves to include
                only the crown group of the set of modern birds. This was done by excluding most groups known only from
                fossils, and assigning them, instead, to the broader group Avialae,[14] on the principle that a clade
                based on extant species should be limited to those extant species and their closest extinct
                relatives.[14]</p>

            <h1 class="h-3">Dinosaurs and the origin</h1>
            <p class="p-2">The consensus view in contemporary palaeontology is that the flying theropods, or avialans,
                are the closest relatives of the deinonychosaurs, which include dromaeosaurids and troodontids.[31]
                Together, these form a group called Paraves. Some basal members of Deinonychosauria, such as
                Microraptor, have features which may have enabled them to glide or fly. The most basal deinonychosaurs
                were very small. This evidence raises the possibility that the ancestor of all paravians may have been
                arboreal, have been able to glide, or both.[32][33] Unlike Archaeopteryx and the non-avialan feathered
                dinosaurs, who primarily ate meat, studies suggest that the first avialans were omnivores.[34]
