            <p>National Lampoon's Animal House is a 1978 American comedy film directed by John Landis and
                written by Harold Ramis, Douglas Kenney and Chris Miller. It stars John Belushi, Tim Matheson, John
                Vernon,
                Verna Bloom, Thomas Hulce, and Donald Sutherland. The film is about a trouble-making fraternity whose
                members challenge the authority of the dean of the fictional Faber College.

                Produced by Matty Simmons of National Lampoon and Ivan Reitman for Universal Pictures, it was inspired
                by
                stories written by Miller and published in National Lampoon, which were based on Ramis' experience in
                the
                Zeta Beta Tau fraternity at Washington University in St. Louis, Miller's Alpha Delta Phi experiences at
                Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, and producer Reitman's at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.

            <h1 class="h-2">Etymology</h1>
            <p class="p-1">The word animal comes from the Latin noun animal of the same meaning, which is itself derived
                from Latin animalis 'having breath or soul'.[6] The biological definition includes all members of the
                kingdom Animalia.[7] In colloquial usage, the term animal is often used to refer only to nonhuman
                animals.[8][9][10][11] The term metazoa is derived from Ancient Greek μετα meta 'after' (in biology, the
                prefix meta- stands for 'later') and ζῷᾰ zōia 'animals', plural of ζῷον zōion 'animal'.[12][13]</p>

            <h1 class="h-3">in human culture</h1>
            <p class="p-2">The human population exploits a large number of other animal species for food, both of domesticated
                livestock species in animal husbandry and, mainly at sea, by hunting wild species.[160][161] Marine fish
                of many species are caught commercially for food. A smaller number of species are farmed
                commercially.[160][162][163] Humans and their livestock make up more than 90% of the biomass of all
                terrestrial vertebrates, and almost as much as all insects combined.[164]

                Invertebrates including cephalopods, crustaceans, insects—principally bees and silkworms—and bivalve or
                gastropod molluscs are hunted or farmed for food, fibres.[165][166] Chickens, cattle, sheep, pigs, and
                other animals are raised as livestock for meat across the world.[161][167][168] Animal fibres such as
                wool and silk are used to make textiles, while animal sinews have been used as lashings and bindings,
                and leather is widely used to make shoes and other items.
