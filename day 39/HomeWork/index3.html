        <p class="p-1">Worms are many different distantly related bilateral animals that typically have a long
            cylindrical tube-like body, no limbs, and usually no eyes.

            Worms vary in size from microscopic to over 1 metre (3.3 ft) in length for marine polychaete worms (bristle
            worms);[1] 6.7 metres (22 ft) for the African giant earthworm, Microchaetus rappi;[2] and 58 metres (190 ft)
            for the marine nemertean worm (bootlace worm), Lineus longissimus.[3] Various types of worm occupy a small
            variety of parasitic niches, living inside the bodies of other animals. Free-living worm species do not live
            on land but instead live in marine or freshwater environments or underground by burrowing.

            In biology, "worm" refers to an obsolete taxon, Vermes, used by Carolus Linnaeus and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck
            for all non-arthropod invertebrate animals, now seen to be paraphyletic. The name stems from the Old English
            word wyrm. Most animals called "worms" are invertebrates, but the term is also used for the amphibian
            caecilians and the slowworm Anguis, a legless burrowing lizard. Invertebrate animals commonly called "worms"</p>
