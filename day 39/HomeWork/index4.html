        <p class="p-1">Grass is a type of plant with narrow leaves growing from the base. Their appearance as a common
            plant was in the mid-Cretaceous period. There are 12,000 species now.[3]

            A common kind of grass is used to cover the ground in places such as lawns and parks. Grass is usually the
            color green. That is because they are wind-pollinated rather than insect-pollinated, so they do not have to
            attract insects. Green is the best colour for photosynthesis.

            Grasslands such as savannah and prairie are where grasses are dominant. They cover 40.5% of the land area of
            the Earth, but not Greenland and Antarctica.[4]

            Grasses are monocotyledon herbaceous plants. They include the "grass" of the family Poaceae, which are
            called grass by ordinary people. This family is also called the Gramineae and includes some of the sedges
            (Cyperaceae) and the rushes (Juncaceae).[5] These three families are not very closely related, though all of
            them belong to clades in the order Poales. They are similar adaptations to a similar life-style.

            With about 780 genera and about 12,000 species,[3] the Poaceae is the fifth-largest plant family. Only the
            Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae have more species.[6]</p>
