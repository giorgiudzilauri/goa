    <h1><b>Linkin Park</b></h1>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Linkin Park</b> is an <strong>American rock</strong>band formed in <b>Agoura Hills,</b> California, in 1996. The band's current lineup consists of vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn, bassist Dave Farrell, co-lead vocalist Emily Armstrong, and drummer Colin Brittain. The lineup for the band's first seven studio albums included lead vocalist Chester Bennington and drummer Rob Bourdon until Bennington's death by suicide in July 2017, which caused the band to enter an indefinite hiatus. <i>In September 2024, </i>Linkin Park's reformation was announced along with the addition of Armstrong and Brittain.</p>
