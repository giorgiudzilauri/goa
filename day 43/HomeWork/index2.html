        <h1>Horse</h1>
        <p>The horse (Equus ferus caballus)[2][3] is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal. It belongs to the
            taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. The horse has evolved over the
            past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal
            of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE, and their domestication is believed to have
            been widespread by 3000 BCE. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated
            populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, which are
            horses that never have been domesticated. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe
            equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds,
            locomotion, and behavior.</p>
