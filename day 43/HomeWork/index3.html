        <p>Belgian cuisine is widely varied among regions, while also reflecting the cuisines of neighbouring France,
            Germany and the Netherlands. It is characterised by the combination of French cuisine with the more hearty
            Flemish fare. Outside the country, Belgium is best known for its chocolate, waffles, fries and beer.

            Though Belgium has many distinctive national dishes, many internationally popular foods like hamburgers and
            spaghetti bolognese are also popular in Belgium, and most of what Belgians eat is also eaten in neighbouring
            countries. "Belgian cuisine" therefore usually refers to dishes of Belgian origin, or those considered
            typically Belgian.

            Belgian cuisine traditionally prizes regional and seasonal ingredients. Ingredients typical in Belgian
            dishes include potatoes, leeks, grey shrimp, white asparagus, Belgian endive, horse meat and local beer, in
            addition to common European staples including meat, cheese and butter. Belgians typically eat four meals a
            day, with a light breakfast, medium lunch, a snack, and a large dinner.

            Belgium has a plethora of local dishes and products. Examples include waterzooi from Ghent, couque biscuit
            from the town of Dinant, and tarte au riz from Verviers. While their local origins are acknowledged, most
            such dishes are enjoyed throughout Belgium.</p>
