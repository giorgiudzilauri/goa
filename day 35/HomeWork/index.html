        <h1>Ryusei Shidou</h1>
        
        <p>Ryusei Shido (士し道どう 龍りゅう聖せい Shidō Ryūsei?) is a contender of the Blue Lock, who currently plays as a center forward for France's Paris X Gen in the Neo-Egoist League.
Shido, unlike most forwards, has no concrete dream of becoming the world's best striker. He instead seeks to enjoy life to the fullest by playing football; through scoring unique, creative, and "explosive" goals.

Out of the original 300 forwards chosen to be a part of the Blue Lock Project, Shido is an ideal candidate for the type of striker Ego strives to create. After the Blue Lock Eleven played against the Japan U-20, Shido ranked as one of the top players in Blue Lock.</p>
