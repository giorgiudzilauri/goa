    <h1>Baro (king)</h1>
    <p>Shoei "King" Baro (馬狼ばろう 照英しょうえい Barō Shōei?) is a contender of Blue Lock, who currently plays as a striker for Italy's Ubers during the Neo-Egoist League.
        Baro is a very selfish and arrogant type of forward whose main goal is to be the star of the field at all times while he strives to become the world's best striker. When first arriving at Blue Lock, he was a member of Team X during First Selection and tied for top scorer in his designated stratum. After the Blue Lock Eleven played against the Japan U-20 team, Baro ranked as one of the top players in the project.</p>
