    <h1>Hyoma Chigiri</h1>
    <p>Hyoma Chigiri (千ち切ぎり 豹ひょう馬ま Chigiri Hyōma?) is a contender of Blue Lock, who currently plays as a left wing for England's Manshine City during the Neo-Egoist League.
        Chigiri is a forward prodigy who was chained down by a leg injury in his past but he let go of his fears while at Blue Lock so he could continue playing football wholeheartedly. When first arriving at Blue Lock, Chigiri was a member of Team Z. Chigiri spent half of the First Selection avoiding participation or keeping it to a bare minimum but when Isagi motivated him in Team Z's third game, he decided to let go of his fear and play football to become the world's best striker like his rivals.</p>
